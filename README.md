### A bit different form the way I implement ML projects :

#### --> Used to just work on one jupyter notebook and do all EDA, preprocessing, model build and train there
#### --> This repo defined other popular models lie Alexnet and Resnet, and made a custom one by drawing from both architectures
#### ---> Also defined many types of optimizers and loss functions and metrics that can be used in combination with the model types and see performance.
